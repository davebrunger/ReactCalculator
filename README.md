# ReactCalculator

This is a demonstration of a simple calculator using React

It is based on framework created in my [ReactTypescript](https://github.com/davebrunger/ReactTypescript) repository so that I can
work on it easily from Visual Studio, however all of the backend code is now redundant and could simply be removed.
